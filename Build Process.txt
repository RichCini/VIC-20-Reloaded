VIC20cr Reloaded Build Process
2022-08-13


In general, I build boards by component height rather than function. The former allows
for an easier bench build, while the latter enables testing by functional area of the
board. Each has its relative benefits which depend on the builder's confidence in 
building complex boards. I would note that some components are relatively expensive
(the expansion connector, the power switch, and the DE9M, for example) so I leave those
out until I confirm the board works.

Component-Oriented Build
========================
 1.	Axial components:
	Resistors: R1-3, R14-19, R23, R29
	Ferrites: FB3, FB6, FB10, FB12-16
	Inductors: L1
	
 2.	DIP Sockets. If the builder is using crimp-pin style sockets rather than the straight
	or machine pin, I recommend soldering them such that the iron rests on the knee
 	of the crimp and solder is applied in and around the vacant area under the pin
 	opposite where the iron is resting. That way, the solder fills the entire area.

 3.	Radial components:
	Capacitors: C8, C11, C13, C20-21, C31-32; all bypass caps, C48
	Inductors: L3

 4.	Axial (folded) components:
	Resistors: R5-8, R11-13, R27-28, R40-41
	Ferrites: FB1,2,4,5,8,9,11
	
 5.	Transistors

 6.	Other capacitors: C4,6,7,15,17,42

 7.	Crystal and ground wire

 8.	Headers P2, P8, CN1, J301

 9.	Capacitor C33

10.	Switch SW1

11.	Power jack P7

12. 	Fuse F7

13.	Joystick P5

14. 	Serial IEC/Video P3,P4

15.	Expansion Connector P6. Use two small 4-40 screws to secure to the board to 
	provide some strain relief.
